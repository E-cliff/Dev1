# Dev1
At-home project. A program that reads in a paragraph from a file (input.txt) and generates a histogram
of the words used, sorted from most occurrences to least. The output consists of the word followed by a
pipe character ("|"), a number of equal signs that are proportional to the number of occurrences found in the
text, and the number of occurrences itself. The program reads in the paragraph defined in
the input.txt file and generates a histograph stored in an output file (output.txt).
